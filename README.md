## ✏️ How does it work?

For now, you can add, edit and delete multiple memos (altough memos are not stored anywhere and they disappear when refreshing the page).  

You can add a new memo by pressing the "+" top-right button. All your memos are shown inside cute, minimalist boxes. You can edit a memo and it will be show at the top. You can also delete a memo to definitely erase it from this universe. 🌌  

This project is a wip.
